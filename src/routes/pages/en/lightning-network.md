## What is the Lightning Network?

The Lightning Network is a "second-layer" protocol built on top of Bitcoin that enables instant, high-volume micropayments at minimal cost. As the technology powering Flash's instant payment capabilities, Lightning Network solves Bitcoin's scalability challenges without compromising its core security and decentralization.

Developed in 2015 and launched in 2018, Lightning has grown into a global network handling millions of transactions daily, making Bitcoin practical for everyday purchases and remittances.

## Why Lightning Network Matters

While Bitcoin's base layer provides exceptional security and finality, it has limitations that make it impractical for everyday payments:

### Bitcoin Base Layer Limitations

- **Limited Throughput**: ~7 transactions per second globally
- **Confirmation Times**: 10 minutes to hours for secure confirmation
- **Fee Variability**: Fees fluctuate based on network demand
- **Minimum Economical Size**: Small payments become impractical due to fees

### Lightning Network Solutions

Lightning addresses these limitations by enabling:

- **Near-Infinite Scalability**: Millions of transactions per second
- **Instant Settlements**: Payments confirm in milliseconds
- **Negligible Fees**: Typically less than a cent regardless of amount
- **True Micropayments**: Efficient payments as small as a fraction of a cent
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Individual transactions not recorded on the blockchain

## How Lightning Works

Lightning Network achieves its remarkable capabilities through a clever system of payment channels:

### Payment Channels

At its core, Lightning creates direct payment channels between users:

1. **Channel Opening**: Two parties create a payment channel by committing funds to a special Bitcoin transaction
2. **Off-Chain Transactions**: They can then exchange funds instantly and privately within this channel
3. **Unlimited Transfers**: Parties can conduct unlimited transactions without touching the blockchain
4. **Final Settlement**: When finished, the channel can be closed, settling the final balances on the Bitcoin blockchain

### Network of Channels

The true power comes from connecting these channels into a network:

- **Routed Payments**: Alice can pay Dave without a direct channel by routing through connected users (Alice → Bob → Charlie → Dave)
- **Automatic Pathfinding**: Lightning automatically finds the optimal path for payments
- **No Trust Required**: Cryptographic techniques ensure funds can't be stolen during routing
- **Redundant Paths**: Multiple possible routes create resilience and competition

### Security Model

Lightning maintains Bitcoin's security guarantees:

- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain control of their funds at all times
- **Cryptographic Enforcement**: Smart contracts ensure funds can only go to intended recipients
- **Watchtowers**: Services monitor channels for attempted fraud
- **Force-Close Protections**: Users can unilaterally close channels if counterparties disappear

## How Flash Uses Lightning
