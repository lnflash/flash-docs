## What is the Chat Tab?

The Chat Tab is a full-featured messaging platform built directly into Flash that leverages the NOSTR protocol to provide secure, censorship-resistant communication. Unlike traditional messaging apps that rely on centralized servers, Flash Chat uses a decentralized network that ensures your messages remain accessible and cannot be censored.

### Key Features

- **Decentralized Messaging**: Messages are distributed across multiple independent relay servers, with no single point of failure or censorship. Your conversations remain accessible even if individual servers go offline.

- **Integrated Bitcoin Payments**: Send Bitcoin payments (Zaps) directly within conversations with minimal fees using Lightning Network.

- **Cross-Platform & Group Chat**: Connect with users on other NOSTR-compatible apps and create both private one-on-one chats and group conversations with multiple participants.

## Getting Started with Chat

Follow these steps to begin using Flash Chat:

1. **Access the Chat Tab**
   - Open the Flash app and tap the Chat icon in the bottom navigation bar

2. **Set Up Your NOSTR Profile**
   - Create a username and optional profile picture
   - Back up your private key when prompted

3. **Find Friends and Contacts**
   - Flash automatically syncs with your existing contacts
   - Search for friends by username or scan a QR code

4. **Start Messaging**
   - Tap on a contact to open a conversation
   - Messages are delivered even if the recipient is offline

## Privacy and Security

Flash Chat is designed with privacy and security in mind:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Private messages are encrypted using NIP-04 standards, and only the intended recipient can decrypt your messages.

- **Key Management**: Back up your private key in a secure location and never share it with anyone.

- **Data Ownership**: Your data belongs to you, not Flash. You can export your conversations and contacts at any time.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Flash Chat:

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, try closing and reopening the app, and check relay status.

- **Message Delivery Problems**: Messages may be delayed during high traffic. Verify you have the correct public key for your contact.

- **Payment Issues**: Ensure you have sufficient balance and verify the recipient has a valid Lightning address.
