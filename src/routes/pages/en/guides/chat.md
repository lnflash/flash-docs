## What is Flash Chat?

The Flash Chat is a full-featured messaging platform built directly into Flash that leverages the NOSTR protocol to provide secure, censorship-resistant communication. Unlike traditional messaging apps that rely on centralized servers, Flash Chat uses a decentralized network that ensures your messages remain accessible and cannot be lost or censored.

### Key Features

-   **Decentralized Messaging**: Messages are distributed across multiple independent relay servers, with no single point of failure or censorship. Your conversations remain accessible even if individual servers go offline.

-   **Integrated bitcoin Payments**: Send bitcoin payments (Zaps) directly within conversations with minimal fees using Lightning Network and eCash on the Cashu Protocol.

-   **Cross-Platform & Group Chat**: Connect with users on other NOSTR-compatible apps and create private one-on-one chats and group conversations with multiple participants.

## Getting Started with Chat

Follow these steps to begin using Flash Chat:

1. **Access the Chat Tab**

    - Open the Flash app go to settings
    - Under Experimental, press the "Enable Chat" toggle
    - The Chat tab will appear in the app's main menu

2. **Find Friends and Contacts**

    - Flash automatically syncs with your existing Flash contacts
    - Search for friends by username or scan a QR code

3. **Start Messaging**
    - Tap on a contact to open a conversation
    - Messages are delivered even if the recipient is offline

## Privacy and Security

Flash Chat is designed with privacy and security in mind:

-   **End-to-End Encryption**: Private messages are encrypted using NIP-17 standards, and only the intended recipient can decrypt your messages.

-   **Key Management**: Back up your private key in a secure location and never share it with anyone.

-   **Data Ownership**: Your data belongs to you, not Flash. You can export your conversations and contacts at any time. Flash never has access to your private keys or messages.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Flash Chat:

-   **Connection Issues**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection, try closing and reopening the app

-   **Payment Issues**: Ensure you have sufficient balance and verify the recipient has a valid username.
