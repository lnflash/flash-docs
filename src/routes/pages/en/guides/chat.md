## What is the Chat Tab?

The Chat Tab is a messaging platform built into Flash that leverages the NOSTR protocol for secure, censorship-resistant communication. With the Chat Tab, you can:

- Start individual or group conversations with friends
- Enjoy persistent messaging that stays online thanks to the distributed NOSTR network
- Connect with users on other NOSTR-compatible apps, not just Flash
- Send Bitcoin payments (Zaps) directly within your conversations

## How to Use the Chat Tab

Getting started with the Chat Tab is simple:

1. Open Flash and tap the Chat icon in the bottom navigation bar
2. Create your NOSTR profile if you haven't already
3. Find friends through the contacts list or by searching their NOSTR public key
4. Start messaging instantly

The Chat Tab automatically syncs with your existing Flash contacts and shows them as available for messaging if they're using NOSTR.

## What is NOSTR?

NOSTR (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is an open protocol that enables censorship-resistant communication. Unlike traditional social networks or messaging apps that rely on central servers, NOSTR distributes your messages across multiple independent relay servers, making it nearly impossible for anyone to silence your communication.

Key benefits of NOSTR include:
- No central authority that can control or censor your messages
- Your identity is tied to cryptographic keys you control, not a company's database
- Messages are signed cryptographically, preventing impersonation
- You can choose which relays to connect to, giving you control over your data

## Why is NOSTR important?

In a world where big tech companies control our communication channels and can restrict access at any time, NOSTR provides a truly open alternative. NOSTR is:

- Censorship-resistant: No single entity can silence you
- Globally accessible: Works anywhere with internet access
- Open and interoperable: Multiple apps can connect to the same network
- Self-sovereign: You own your identity and data

For Flash users, NOSTR integration means your messaging isn't locked into one app or company. If Flash were to disappear tomorrow, you could access your messages and contacts using any other NOSTR-compatible app.

## What are Zaps?

Zaps are Bitcoin micropayments sent directly within a chat using the Lightning Network. With Zaps, you can:

- Send as little as a few sats (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) to friends
- Tip content creators for posts you enjoy
- Split bills or pay your share instantly
- Support projects and causes you believe in

To send a Zap in Flash:
1. Open a chat with a friend
2. Tap the lightning bolt icon
3. Enter the amount you want to send
4. Confirm the payment

The recipient will receive the Bitcoin instantly, even if they're using a different NOSTR client with Lightning capabilities.

## Flash Support Channel

Once you open the Chat Tab, you can join the global Flash support channel to ask questions and get help from both the Flash team and community members. The support channel is public and accessible to anyone with a NOSTR-compatible chat app.

To join:
1. Open the Chat Tab
2. Look for "Flash Support" in your channel list
3. Join the conversation
