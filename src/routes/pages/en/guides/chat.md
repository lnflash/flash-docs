## What is the Chat Tab?

The Chat Tab is a chat app built in Flash on top of the NOSTR protocol. 
You can start a chat with one or more friends, and be confident that your communications will stay online because they are distributed across the NOSTR network of nodes.
As a bonus, since NOSTR is an open communications network, you can chat with your friends who don't have Flash installed, as long as they have a NOSTR compatible chat app.

## What are Zaps?

Zaps are a way to send money to your friends in a chat. You can send a Zap to anyone in your chat, even if they don't have a Flash wallet.


## Flash Support Channel

Once you open the Chat Tab you can chat in the global flash support channel and ask any support questions you may have. We will answer as soon as possible, and other users may also be able to help you. This is a public chat, so anyone with a NOSTR compatible chat app can see it and assist!

Active development of NOSTR is happening on [Github](https://github.com/nostr/nostr)
