A Pro or Merchant account is required to settle directly from your Flash wallet to your Jamaican bank account. Do it quickly and easily with these steps:

#### Step 1: Initiate the transfer in your Flash app

1. Open your Flash app and press the "Settle" button on the home screen
2. Enter the amount you want to transfer to your bank account
3. Tap "Next" to proceed
4. Review the transfer details and tap "Continue"
5. Review the details of your settlement, including the fees and estimated arrival time
6. Tap "Confirm" to start the process

#### Step 2: Receive your funds

1. ACH transfers typically arrive within 0-1 business days
2. RTGS transfers usually arrive the same day if initiated before 1:00 PM on business days
3. You'll receive a notification on your Flash app when the transfer is processed
4. Check your bank account to confirm receipt of the funds

_Note: Bank transfers are subject to standard banking hours and may be delayed during weekends or holidays. Bank minimum and maximum transfer limits may apply._

## Cash Out at a Flashpoint
