## Step 2 â€“ Locate a flashpoint nearest to you

Unlike other remittance and money services, any business can be a flashpoint. This means that you can cash out at any business that accepts Flash. In addition to the Map tab, you can find a list of businesses that accept Flash on our [Flashpoint Map](https://flashpoint.flashapp.me).
