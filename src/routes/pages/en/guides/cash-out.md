3. Enter the amount you want to transfer to your bank account

#### Step 2: Enter your banking details
1. Select your bank from the list of supported Jamaican banks
2. Enter your account number
3. Confirm that the account name matches your Flash account name
4. Choose either ACH (1-2 business days) or RTGS (same-day transfers)

#### Step 3: Review and confirm
1. Review all details of your transfer carefully
2. Enter your Flash PIN or use biometric authentication to confirm
3. You'll receive a confirmation with a reference number
4. Keep this reference number until the funds appear in your bank account

#### Step 4: Receive your funds
1. ACH transfers typically arrive within 1-2 business days
2. RTGS transfers usually arrive the same day if initiated before 1:00 PM on business days
3. You'll receive a notification on your Flash app when the transfer is processed
4. Check your bank account to confirm receipt of the funds

*Note: Bank transfers are subject to standard banking hours and may be delayed during weekends or holidays. Minimum and maximum transfer limits may apply.*

## Go to the Maps Tab on your Flash App

On the Map tab you will see an interactive map that shows you all the businesses that accept Flash.

## Locate a flashpoint nearest to you

Unlike other remittance and money services, any business can be a flashpoint. This means that you can cash out at any business that accepts Flash. In addition to the Map tab, you can find a list of businesses that accept Flash on our [Flashpoint Map](https://flashpoint.flashapp.me).
