3. Enter the amount you want to transfer to your bank account

#### Step 2: Enter your banking details
1. Select your bank from the list of supported Jamaican banks
2. Enter your account number
3. Confirm that the account name matches your Flash account name
4. Choose either ACH (1-2 business days) or RTGS (same-day transfers)

#### Step 3: Review and confirm
1. Review all details of your transfer carefully
2. Enter your Flash PIN or use biometric authentication to confirm
3. You'll receive a confirmation with a reference number
4. Keep this reference number until the funds appear in your bank account

#### Step 4: Receive your funds
1. ACH transfers typically arrive within 1-2 business days
2. RTGS transfers usually arrive the same day if initiated before 1:00 PM on business days
3. You'll receive a notification on your Flash app when the transfer is processed
4. Check your bank account to confirm receipt of the funds

*Note: Bank transfers are subject to standard banking hours and may be delayed during weekends or holidays. Minimum and maximum transfer limits may apply.*

## Cash Out at a Flashpoint

Any business that accepts Flash can be a "Flashpoint" where you can turn your digital Cash into physical cash. Here's how to do it:

### 1. Find a Flashpoint on the Map
Open your Flash app and go to the Maps tab. You'll see an interactive map showing all nearby businesses that accept Flash.
