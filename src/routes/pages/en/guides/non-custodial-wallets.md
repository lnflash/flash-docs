## What Are Non-Custodial Wallets?

Non-custodial wallets are Bitcoin wallets where you, and only you, control the private keys to your funds. This means you have complete ownership and control over your Bitcoin without relying on a third party to hold or manage your assets.

The fundamental principle is simple: **not your keys, not your coins**. When you use a non-custodial wallet, you're directly interacting with the Bitcoin network, giving you full financial sovereignty.

## Why Use a Non-Custodial Wallet?

Using a non-custodial wallet provides several important benefits:

- **Complete control**: No one else can access, freeze, or seize your funds
- **Security**: Your Bitcoin isn't vulnerable to exchange hacks or company insolvency
- **Privacy**: Many non-custodial options don't require personal information
- **Financial sovereignty**: You're not dependent on any company or service to access your Bitcoin
- **Self-reliance**: Your access to funds doesn't depend on a company staying in business
- **Censorship resistance**: No one can prevent you from sending or receiving transactions

## Types of Non-Custodial Wallets

Non-custodial wallets come in various forms, each with different security and convenience trade-offs:

### Mobile Wallets

Perfect for everyday use with smaller amounts of Bitcoin. These wallets run on your smartphone, making your Bitcoin accessible wherever you go.

**Popular options:**
- [Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io/) - Feature-rich with both Lightning and on-chain support
- [Muun Wallet](https://muun.com/) - User-friendly with simplified backup procedures
- [Blockstream Green](https://blockstream.com/green/) - Strong security features with two-factor authentication
- [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) - Lightning-focused with simplified channel management

### Desktop Wallets

More robust options that run on your computer, offering better security and features than mobile wallets.

**Popular options:**
- [Electrum](https://electrum.org/) - Advanced features for experienced users
- [Sparrow Wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) - Privacy-focused with coin control features
- [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) - The reference implementation that runs a full node

### Hardware Wallets

Physical devices designed specifically for securely storing cryptocurrency private keys. These are the best option for storing larger amounts of Bitcoin securely.

**Popular options:**
- [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) - Sleek devices with support for multiple cryptocurrencies
- [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) - Open-source hardware wallets with strong security features
- [ColdCard](https://coldcard.com/) - Bitcoin-only hardware wallet with advanced security features
- [BitBox](https://shiftcrypto.ch/) - Minimalist design with strong security

### Paper Wallets

The most basic form of cold storage, where private keys are printed on paper and stored physically. While not recommended for beginners, they can be a secure backup method.

## Choosing the Right Wallet for You

The best wallet depends on your specific needs:

- **For beginners**: Start with user-friendly mobile wallets like Muun or Blue Wallet
- **For everyday spending**: Mobile wallets offer convenience for daily transactions
- **For larger amounts**: Hardware wallets provide the best security for savings
- **For privacy concerns**: Wallets like Sparrow offer enhanced privacy features

## Security Best Practices

When using non-custodial wallets, follow these security practices:

1. **Secure your seed phrase**
   - Write it down on paper (never digitally)
   - Store it in a secure location, protected from fire and water damage
   - Never share it with anyone

2. **Use strong passwords** for any wallet that requires them

3. **Keep software updated** to ensure you have the latest security patches

4. **Consider a multi-signature setup** for large amounts, requiring multiple keys to authorize transactions

5. **Test recovery procedures** periodically to ensure you can regain access if needed

## From Flash to Non-Custodial: Making the Transition

While Flash offers the convenience of a custodial wallet, transitioning some of your Bitcoin to non-custodial storage is easy:

1. **Choose and set up** your non-custodial wallet
2. **Generate a receiving address** in your new wallet
3. **Send a small test amount** from Flash to verify everything works
4. **Send larger amounts** once you're comfortable with the process

Consider maintaining a balance in Flash for everyday spending while storing larger amounts in your non-custodial wallet. This hybrid approach gives you both convenience and security.
