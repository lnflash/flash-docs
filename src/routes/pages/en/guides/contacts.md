## Accessing Your Contacts

You can access your contacts through the Chat screen in Flash:

**From the Chat Screen**
- Open the Flash app and tap the Chat icon in the bottom navigation
- At the top of the Chat screen, you'll see a "Contacts" tab that provides access to your contact list

## Finding Contacts

The Contacts interface makes it easy to locate the people you want to connect with:

1. **Browse Your Contact List**
   - Your contacts are automatically sorted with most frequent interactions at the top
   - Scroll through your list to find people you regularly transact with

2. **Use the Search Bar**
   - At the top of the Contacts view, you'll find a search bar
   - Tap it and enter a name to quickly find specific contacts
   - This is especially useful when you have many contacts in your list

## Adding New Contacts

Flash offers multiple ways to add new contacts to your network:

1. **Add Manually**
   - Tap the "+" button in the top-right corner of the Contacts view
   - Enter their Flash username or Lightning address
   - Confirm to add them to your contacts

2. **Scan a QR Code**
   - From the "+" menu, select the scan option
   - Use your camera to scan someone's Flash QR code
   - This instantly adds them to your contacts

3. **Automatic Addition**
   - Flash automatically adds people to your contacts when you send or receive a payment
   - This creates a self-maintaining system focused on actual financial relationships
   - No manual contact management required

## Interacting with Contacts

Once you've added contacts, you can interact with them in several ways:

### Viewing Contact Details

- Tap on any contact to open their profile
- Here you'll see their profile information, transaction history, and available actions
- Contact details include their username, profile picture, and payment address

### Starting a Chat

- From a contact's profile, tap the "Message" button to open or create a chat thread
- You can also send messages directly from the chat tab by selecting the contact
- Messages are end-to-end encrypted when both users are on the NOSTR protocol

### Viewing Transaction History

- Each contact's profile displays your complete payment history
- This helps you track your financial interactions over time
- The history includes payment amounts, dates, and any attached notes

## Sending Bitcoin to Contacts

Flash makes it simple to send Bitcoin to your contacts:

### Send from Contact Profile

- Open a contact's profile and tap the "Send" button
- Enter the amount, add an optional note, and confirm the payment
- The transaction is processed instantly via the Lightning Network

### Send from Chat

- During a chat conversation, tap the Lightning icon to initiate a payment
- This allows you to seamlessly mix communication and payments in a single thread
- The recipient receives a notification of your payment in the chat

### Quick Payments with Saved Amounts

- For frequent contacts, Flash may display quick payment buttons
- These common amounts are based on your payment history
- Tap a quick payment button to send that amount with just one action

## Contact Privacy and Security

Your Flash contacts are designed with privacy and security as priorities:

- **Local Storage**: Your contact list is stored only on your device, not on centralized servers

- **Private Relationships**: Your transaction history remains private between you and each contact

- **NOSTR Integration**: Contacts who also use NOSTR provide end-to-end encrypted messaging

- **Manual Control**: You can remove any contact at any time by swiping left on their entry and tapping "Delete"

The Contacts feature in Flash creates a seamless bridge between your social connections and financial transactions, making Bitcoin payments as simple as sending a message.
