## Accessing Your Contacts

You can access your contacts through the Chat screen in Flash:

**From the Chat Screen**

-   Open the Flash app and tap the Chat icon in the bottom navigation
-   At the top of the Chat screen, you'll see a "Contacts" tab that provides access to your contact list

## Finding Contacts

The Contacts interface makes it easy to locate the people you want to connect with:

1. **Browse Your Contact List**

    - Your contacts are automatically sorted with most frequent interactions at the top
    - Scroll through your list to find people you regularly transact with

2. **Use the Search Bar**
    - At the top of the Contacts view, you'll find a search bar
    - Tap it and enter a name to quickly find specific contacts
    - This is especially useful when you have many contacts in your list

## Adding New Contacts

Flash offers multiple ways to add new contacts to your network:

1. **Add Manually**

    - Press the search bar at the top of the Contacts screen
    - Enter their Flash username or Lightning address
    - Press the add icon to add them to your contacts

2. **Automatic Addition**
    - Flash automatically adds people to your contacts when you send or receive a payment
    - This creates a self-maintaining system focused on actual financial relationships
    - No manual contact management required

## Interacting with Contacts

Once you've added contacts, you can interact with them in several ways:

### Viewing Contact Details

-   Tap on any contact to open their profile
-   Here you'll see their profile information, transaction history, and available actions
-   Contact details include their username and payment address

### Starting a Chat

-   From a contact's profile, tap the "Message" button to open or create a chat thread
-   You can also send messages directly from the chat tab by selecting the contact
-   Messages are end-to-end encrypted when both users are on the NOSTR protocol

### Viewing Transaction History

-   Each contact's profile displays your complete payment history
-   This helps you track your financial interactions over time
-   The history includes payment amounts, dates, and any attached notes

## Sending bitcoin to Contacts

Flash makes it simple to send bitcoin to your contacts:

### Send from Contact Profile

-   Open a contact's profile and tap the lightning icon in the top right corner
-   Enter the amount, add an optional note, and confirm the payment
-   The transaction is processed instantly via the Lightning Network

### Send from Chat

-   During a chat conversation, tap the Lightning icon to initiate a payment
-   This allows you to seamlessly mix communication and payments in a single thread
-   The recipient receives a notification of your payment in the chat

### Quick Payments with Saved Amounts

-   For frequent contacts, Flash may display quick payment buttons
-   These common amounts are based on your payment history
-   Tap a quick payment button to send that amount with just one action

## Contact Privacy and Security

Your Flash contacts are designed with privacy and security as priorities:

-   **Local Storage**: Your contact list is stored on decentralized NOSTR servers, not on Flash's servers

-   **Private Relationships**: Your transaction history remains private between you and each contact

-   **NOSTR Integration**: Contacts who also use NOSTR provide end-to-end encrypted messaging

-   **Manual Control**: You can remove any contact at any time by swiping left on their entry and tapping the delete icon

The Contacts feature in Flash creates a seamless bridge between your social connections and financial transactions, making bitcoin payments as simple as sending a message.
