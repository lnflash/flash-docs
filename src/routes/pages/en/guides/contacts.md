## What is the Contacts Tab?

The Contacts Tab in Flash is your personal directory of payment relationships. Unlike traditional contact lists that are manually created, Flash's Contacts tab intelligently builds and maintains a list of people and businesses you frequently interact with financially.

This smart contact system makes it easy to:
- Quickly find and pay your frequent contacts
- Track your payment history with each person
- Connect with contacts through chat
- Discover businesses you frequently visit

## Automatic Contact Management

### How Contacts Are Added

Flash automatically adds someone to your Contacts when:
- You send them a payment
- You receive a payment from them
- You save someone's payment information manually

This creates a seamless, self-maintaining system that focuses on your actual payment relationships rather than requiring manual contact management.

## Are these my Phone Contacts?

No, these are not your phone contacts. The contacts in Flash are completely separate from your device's contact list and are based solely on your financial interactions within the app.

This separation provides several benefits:
- **Privacy**: Your Flash contacts exist only within the app
- **Relevance**: Only people you actually transact with appear
- **Simplicity**: No manual syncing or importing needed

## Using Your Contacts List

The Contacts tab organizes your payment relationships in helpful ways:

### Finding Frequent Contacts
1. Open Flash and tap the Contacts icon in the bottom navigation
2. Your contacts are automatically sorted with most frequent at the top
3. Use the search bar to quickly find a specific contact
4. Recent payments appear for each contact, showing your transaction history

### Making Payments to Contacts
1. Tap on any contact in your list
2. Select the payment amount
3. Add an optional note
4. Send the payment instantly

### Contact Details View
When you tap on a contact, you can:
- View your complete transaction history with them
- See their payment information
- Access quick payment buttons for common amounts
- Find options to message them

## Integrating with the Chat Tab

The Contacts and Chat tabs work together seamlessly:

1. From any contact, tap the "Message" button
2. This opens a chat thread with that contact in the Chat tab
3. You can send both messages and payments within the chat
4. All contacts with active chats appear in both tabs for easy access

Check out the [Chat Tab Guide](/en/guides/chat) for more detailed information about Flash's messaging capabilities.

## Businesses in Your Contacts

When you transact with a Flash Business account, they appear in your contacts with special designation:

- Business contacts show their business name and logo
- You can see their business hours and services offered
- Quick navigation to their location on the Map tab is available
- Payment history shows your spending patterns with that business

## Privacy and Security

Your contact list is private and stored only on your device. Flash's smart contact system ensures:

- Only relevant financial relationships appear in your list
- No contact information is shared without your permission
- Your transaction history remains private between you and each contact
- You can manually remove any contact if desired

## Advanced Contact Management

### Adding Contacts Manually
While Flash automatically manages most contacts, you can manually add someone:
1. Tap the "+" button in the Contacts tab
2. Enter their Flash username or scan their QR code
3. Save them to your contacts
4. Now you can easily pay them, even before your first transaction

### Organizing Your Contacts
You can customize your contact list by:
- Starring favorite contacts to pin them to the top
- Adding notes to remember context about each relationship
- Hiding contacts you no longer need to see

## NOSTR Integration

For contacts who also use NOSTR (through the Chat tab), you gain additional capabilities:
- End-to-end encrypted messaging
- Contact portability across NOSTR-compatible apps
- Decentralized identity verification

The Contacts tab is your gateway to frictionless payments with the people and businesses in your life. As you use Flash more, this intelligent system learns your payment patterns and makes financial interactions increasingly seamless.
