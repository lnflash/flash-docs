## What is the Map Tab?

The Map Tab is a powerful feature in Flash that helps you discover local businesses and individuals accepting bitcoin payments through Flash. This interactive map shows "Flashpoints" in your area, creating a global network of bitcoin-friendly locations where you can:

-   Spend your bitcoin at local businesses
-   Exchange bitcoin for physical cash
-   Find Flash community members near you
-   Support the growing bitcoin economy

## What is a Flashpoint?

A Flashpoint is a local business or individual accepting Flash payments for goods, services, or cash exchange. Flashpoints are displayed on the map as distinctive orange pins, making them easy to spot.

Flashpoints come in several categories:

-   **Merchants** - Businesses accepting bitcoin payments for goods and services
-   **Exchanges** - Locations where you can exchange bitcoin for physical cash or vice versa
-   **Community Hubs** - Places where Flash and bitcoin enthusiasts gather
-   **Rewards** - Locations offering special promotions or discounts for Flash users

## Using the Map Tab

### Setting Up Location Permissions

Since this is a GPS-enabled map, Flash may need your location to show nearby Flashpoints. When you first open the Map Tab, you'll be asked to grant Flash permission to use your location. This permission is optional - if you prefer not to share your location, you can manually navigate the map to find Flashpoints.

To enable location services:

1. Tap the Map Tab
2. When prompted, select "Allow" for location access
3. Your current location will appear on the map with nearby Flashpoints

For privacy-conscious users, you can:

-   Grant location permission only while using the app
-   Manually search areas without sharing your location
-   Turn location services off when not needed

### Finding Flashpoints Near You

The Map Tab makes it easy to discover Flashpoints wherever you are:

1. Open the Flash app and tap the Map icon
2. Browse the map to see orange pins indicating Flashpoints
3. Use the filter options to find specific types of Flashpoints
4. Tap on a pin to view details about the location

You can also search for specific locations or businesses using the search bar at the top of the screen.
