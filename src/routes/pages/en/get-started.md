## [ยง](#understanding-bitcoin) Understanding Bitcoin

Flash is built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin is a global, peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, open monetary network. It's a mouthful, but let's break it down:

-   **Global** - Bitcoin is a global network. Anyone with an internet connection can access it.

-   **Peer-to-peer** - Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network. This means that there is no central authority that controls the network. Instead, the network is made up of many different computers that all talk to each other.

-   **Censorship-resistant** - Bitcoin is censorship-resistant. This means that no one can stop you from sending or receiving money on the network. No one can stop you from creating a wallet, or from sending money to anyone else.

-   **Open** - Bitcoin is open. This means that anyone see the code that the Bitcoin protocol uses, and anyone can build on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Anyone can create a wallet, or a business that accepts Bitcoin, or a service that helps people use Bitcoin.

-   **Monetary network** - Bitcoin is a monetary network. This means that it is a network that allows people to send and receive money. Bitcoin is a form of money, just like the US dollar or the Jamaican dollar. But Bitcoin is different from other forms of money because it is not controlled by any government or company. Instead, it is controlled by the people who use it.

## [ยง](#what-is-flash) What is Flash?

Flash is an easy to use mobile and web payments application. Flash is also a digital point-of-sale service that you can sign up for if you are a business. Flash allows you to accept payments from your customers globally using the Bitcoin open monetary network. Flash business accounts can also do in person exchanges with other Flash users for other currencies like US dollars or Jamaican Dollars.

Flash is designed for simplicity and enables censorship-resistant and globally decentralized value transfer. Let's unpack that a little:

-   **Simple** - The mobile app is designed to be as simple as possible to use. It's a single screen that shows your balance and allows you to send and receive money. All additional features are hidden behind a menu, or in in a separate tab. The business account is also designed to be very simple to use, with a short and effortless cash-out flow and a simple interface for accepting payments.

-   **Resilient** - Because Flash doesn't completely rely on any exchange or bank, it's very resilient. The Bitcoin wallet is non-custodial, meaning that you are in control of your own money. The USD wallet is custodial, but your value can be swapped between the two wallets at any time. This means that if, for any reason, the Flash custodial wallet is not available, you can still access your money on the non-custodial Bitcoin wallet without needing to rely on anyone else. We recommend you treat your non-custodial Bitcoin wallet as your savings account, and only use the custodial USD wallet for short term storage of value and spending, like a checking account.

-   **Verifiable** - Because Flash wallets are based on [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and the [Bitcoin protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_protocol), you can verify that your money is safe at any time, from any internet-connected device. 

**Bottom Line** - You are never required to trust Flash or any other company with your money.

## Creating a new business account (includes a short verification process)

1. Click "Setup Business Account".
1. Read through and accept the EULA.

You will receive a notification when your account is approved. On this screen, click "Finish" and you're ready to use Flash! The cash-out functionality will be enabled once your account is approved.
