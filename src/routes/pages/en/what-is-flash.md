## What is Flash?

Flash is a Bitcoin service provider creating products and services specifically for the Caribbean. Our ecosystem includes the Flash app for everyday users, the Flashpoint point-of-sale device for merchants, the Flash card with rewards and gift card capabilities, and Bitcoin trading services both online and through our app.

### Personal Accounts

Flash offers personal accounts that include both dollar and Bitcoin denominated wallets. Send and receive money globally without intermediaries. The Bitcoin wallet is non-custodial, giving you complete control of your funds.

### Business Accounts

Businesses can use Flash to accept global payments through the Bitcoin network. Flash business accounts enable seamless international transactions with minimal fees and rapid settlement. Businesses can also facilitate in-person exchanges between Bitcoin and local currencies like US dollars or Jamaican dollars. Additionally, businesses with Flashpoint devices participate in our integrated rewards program, allowing them to offer and redeem points across the entire Flash merchant network, increasing customer engagement and loyalty.

### Flash Card

The Flash Card is a prepaid card that allows you to make purchases at regular merchants. The card maintains its own balance separate from your Flash app accounts. Link your Flash Card to the app to conveniently check your card balance and top up funds as needed. Owning a Flash Card automatically provides membership to the Flashpoint rewards network, allowing you to earn reward points when shopping at participating merchants. This integration provides flexibility while keeping your card and app balances distinct for different use cases.

### Rewards Points

Earn rewards when using Flash. Receive points for transactions, referrals, and regular usage that can be redeemed for Bitcoin or special offers from partner businesses. The Flash rewards program enhances your purchasing power with points that can be easily spent at all participating Flashpoint merchant locations. Points can also be used online to purchase gift cards and digital services through partner platforms like bitrefill.com and thebitcoincompany.com, giving you flexibility to spend your rewards on everyday needs or convert them to Bitcoin seamlessly.
