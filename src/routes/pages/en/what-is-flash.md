## What is Flash?

Flash is a bitcoin service provider creating products and services specifically for the Caribbean. Our ecosystem includes the Flash app for everyday users, the Flashpoint point-of-sale device for merchants, the Flashcard with rewards and gift card capabilities, and bitcoin top-ups and cash settlements both on the Flashcard and through our app.

### Personal Accounts

Flash offers personal accounts that include both dollar and bitcoin denominated wallets. Send and receive money globally without intermediaries. The bitcoin wallet is non-custodial, giving you complete control of your funds.

### Pro Accounts

Flash offers pro accounts that include both dollar and bitcoin denominated wallets, and the ability to top up the dollar denominated wallet from a bank account, and the ability to do a cash settlement to a bank account from the dollar denominated wallet. The bank transfer feature takes 0-1 business days to process (usually same-day), and is available for users in Jamaica. Pro accounts also include the ability to top up the bitcoin wallet from a bank account, and the ability to do a cash settlement to a bank account from the bitcoin wallet. The bitcoin top-up feature takes 1-3 business days to process, and is available for users in Jamaica. Pro accounts are designed for users who want to manage both fiat and bitcoin funds with the convenience of bank transfers, while still enjoying the benefits of a non-custodial bitcoin wallet.

### Merchant Accounts

Businesses can use Flash to accept global payments through the bitcoin network by signing up for our merchant account. Flash merchant accounts enable seamless international transactions with minimal fees and rapid settlement. Businesses can also facilitate in-person exchanges between bitcoin and local currencies like US dollars or Jamaican dollars. Additionally, businesses with Flashpoint devices participate in our integrated rewards program, allowing them to offer and redeem points across the entire Flash merchant network, increasing customer engagement and loyalty.

### Flashcard

The Flashcard is a prepaid card that allows you to make purchases at merchants that accept Flash payments (Flashpoints). The card maintains its own balance separate from your Flash app wallets. You can link your Flash Card to the app to conveniently check your card balance and top up funds to the card as needed. Owning a Flash Card automatically provides membership to the Flashpoint rewards network, allowing you to earn reward points when shopping at participating merchants. This integration provides flexibility while keeping your card and app balances distinct for different use cases.

### Rewards Points

Earn rewards when using Flash. Receive points for transactions, referrals, and regular usage that can be redeemed for bitcoin or special offers from partner businesses. The Flash rewards program enhances your purchasing power with points that can be easily spent at all participating Flashpoint merchant locations. Points can also be used online to purchase gift cards and digital services through partner platforms like bitrefill.com and thebitcoincompany.com, giving you flexibility to spend your rewards on everyday needs or convert them to bitcoin seamlessly.
