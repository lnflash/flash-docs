## What is Flash?

Flash is an app that you can use to send and receive Bitcoin, without needing to sign up or give any personal information to us or any other company.

Flash is also a service that you sign up for if you are a business. Flash allows you to accept payments from your customers globally using the Bitcoin open monetary network.

Flash business accounts can also do in person exchanges with other Flash users for other currencies like US dollars or Jamaican Dollars.

Flash is designed for simplicity and enables censorship-resistant and globally decentralized value transfer. Let's unpack that a little:

### Simple

The mobile app is designed to be as simple as possible to use. It's a single screen that shows your balance and allows you to send and receive money. All additional features are hidden behind a menu, or in in a separate tab. 

The business account is also designed to be very simple to use, with a short and effortless cash-out flow and a simple interface for accepting payments.

### Resilient

Because Flash doesn't completely rely on any exchange or bank, it's very resilient. The Bitcoin wallet is non-custodial, meaning that you are in control of your own money. The USD wallet is custodial, but your value can be swapped between the two wallets at any time. This means that if Flash custodial wallet goes down, you can still access your money on the non-custodial Bitcoin wallet.

We recommend you treat your non-custodial Bitcoin wallet as your savings account, and only use the custodial USD wallet for short term storage of value, like a checking account.

### Verifiable

Because Flash wallets are based on [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and the [Bitcoin protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_protocol), you can verify that your money is safe at any time, from any internet-connected device. 

You are never required to trust Flash or any other company with your money.
